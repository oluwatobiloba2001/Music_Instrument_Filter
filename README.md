Here's a **professional and well-structured `README.md`** for your Music Instruments Product Page project:

# 🎵 Music Instruments Product Page

A responsive and interactive product listing page for student musical instruments, built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Users can filter instruments by category using a dropdown menu, and view dynamically updated cards displaying instrument details.

---

## 🔍 Features

* 🎚️ **Filter by Category**: Users can select a category (`All`, `Woodwinds`, `Brass`, or `Percussion`) to view relevant instruments.
* 🧠 **Dynamic Rendering**: The instrument cards update automatically based on user selection, using JavaScript and array filtering.
* 🎨 **Responsive Design**: Styled with CSS Flexbox and responsive breakpoints for optimal viewing on all screen sizes.
* ⚡ **Clean UX**: Smooth interaction without page reloads, and a consistent, accessible layout.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5** – Structure of the webpage
* **CSS3** – Styling, layout, and responsive design
* **JavaScript (ES6)** – Dynamic filtering and DOM manipulation

## 🧩 Project Structure

```
├── index.html         # Main HTML structure
├── styles.css         # CSS styles for layout and design
├── script.js          # JavaScript logic for filtering and rendering
```

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Dropdown Selection**:
   A `<select>` element lets users choose between:

   * All
   * Woodwinds
   * Brass
   * Percussion

2. **Filtering Logic** (`script.js`):
   On change, the selected category is passed to the `instrumentCards` function, which filters the `instrumentsArr` and returns HTML card strings.

3. **Card Rendering**:
   The resulting HTML is joined and injected into `.products-container` using `innerHTML`.

## 📦 Sample Data

Instruments are grouped into categories and include a name and price:

```js
{ category: "woodwinds", instrument: "Flute", price: 500 }
{ category: "brass", instrument: "Trumpet", price: 200 }
{ category: "percussion", instrument: "Drum Set", price: 500 }
```

---

## 🖼️ UI Preview

Each instrument is displayed as a card:

```html
<div class="card">
  <h2>Flute</h2>
  <p>$500</p>
</div>
```

---

## 📱 Responsive Layout

* On smaller screens: cards are stacked vertically.
* On larger screens (≥760px): cards wrap into rows for a grid-like layout.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone or download the project folder.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Use the dropdown to filter and explore the instrument cards.

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

* Add instrument images to each card.
* Include a search bar for keyword filtering.
* Add animations or transitions for smoother UI updates.
* Implement sorting by price or name.
